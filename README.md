# Craps
A simple craps simulator.

I become interested in Craps after a trip to Vegas.  That's what happens when you learn how to play and get really lucky over the course of one weekend!

This was my attempt to create a simple framework to brute force test some betting strategy probabilities through Monte Carlo simulations.  I also took the Module javascript pattern for a test drive from Addy Osmani's great reference <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript">here</a>.
